Constellation Web App Overview
The Constellation Web App provides an interactive platform for users—children, educators, storytellers, and filmmakers—to creatively explore the night sky. Users can upload images of the night sky, where the app identifies and maps the brightest stars, allowing them to connect stars, rename them, and save their unique constellations as images. This experience fosters artistic expression and curiosity about astronomy.

Users can choose between automatic star plotting using computer vision or manually inputting coordinates for a more hands-on approach. The app’s intuitive interface encourages creativity, enabling users to connect stars easily and customize their constellations. Additional features, such as adjusting star sizes and line thickness, enhance the experience and promote social interaction through challenges and games.

Designed for accessibility, the app serves as an engaging educational tool, helping users learn about astronomy and celestial navigation while encouraging collaboration and friendly competition. Future updates aim to expand the platform, allowing users to explore exoplanets and improve star detection, enriching the overall stargazing experience.
